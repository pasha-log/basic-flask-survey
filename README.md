# Basic Flask Satisfaction Survey!

## Description 

In this project I used Flask, Python, and HTML. It displays examples of redirecting, Jinja, and it'll do a flash if you try to add a too large of a number in the query string for the question id. If you try to skip the questions, you'll be forced to answer the boring questions anyways! The survey utilizes Flask session for storing responses made by the user as well.
