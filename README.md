# Basic Flask Satisfaction Survey!

## Description 

In this project I used Flask, Python, and HTML. It displays examples of redirecting, Jinja, and it'll do a flash if you try to add a too large of a number in the query string for the question id. If you try to skip the questions, you'll be forced to answer the boring questions anyways!
